# CNN Model Debugging Fixes Applied

## Problem
The CNN latent conditioner model was not showing decreasing training loss, indicating potential issues with over-regularization, numerical instability, or architectural complexity.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Reduced Over-Regularization
- **DropBlock**: Completely disabled (returned input unchanged)
- **Dropout rates**: Reduced significantly
  - Main dropout: `dropout_rate * 0.5` (e.g., 0.2 → 0.1)
  - Secondary dropout: `dropout_rate * 0.2` (e.g., 0.2 → 0.04)  
  - Tertiary dropout: `dropout_rate * 0.1` (e.g., 0.2 → 0.02)

### 2. ✅ Fixed Spectral Normalization Inconsistency
- **Removed ALL spectral_norm** from all layers for initial testing
- This eliminates potential gradient flow issues from inconsistent spectral norm usage
- Can be re-enabled later once basic training is confirmed working

### 3. ✅ Simplified Architecture
- **Disabled auxiliary heads**: Removed intermediate supervision that could conflict with main loss
- **Disabled uncertainty estimation**: Removed competing loss terms
- **Simplified multi-scale fusion**: Skip complex feature fusion, use final features directly
- **Return format**: Always use simple tuple format `(latent_main, xs_main)`

### 4. ✅ Replaced Aggressive NaN Handling
- **Removed frequent NaN checks**: No more `torch.nan_to_num()` calls throughout forward pass
- **Simplified input validation**: Only basic clamping `torch.clamp(x, min=-10.0, max=10.0)`
- **Gradient clipping**: Already implemented in training loop (`max_norm=1.0`)

### 5. ✅ Simplified GroupNorm Configuration
- **Standardized to 8 groups**: Replaced complex group calculation with simple `nn.GroupNorm(8, channels)`
- **Removed custom epsilon**: Use default PyTorch settings
- More stable and predictable normalization behavior

## Expected Results
- **Training loss should now decrease** consistently
- **Reduced memory usage** due to simpler architecture
- **More stable gradients** due to consistent normalization and reduced regularization
- **Faster convergence** with simplified loss landscape

## Testing Instructions
1. Run training with current CNN model (`input_type=image` in condition.txt)
2. Monitor loss curves - should see steady decrease
3. If training works, gradually re-enable features one by one:
   - First: Re-enable some dropout (start with 0.1-0.2)
   - Then: Re-enable spectral norm on key layers
   - Finally: Re-enable auxiliary heads if needed

## Configuration in condition.txt
The current settings have been optimized:
- `latent_conditioner_lr = 0.001` (increased from 0.00001)
- `latent_conditioner_weight_decay = 1e-5` (reduced from 1e-4)
- `latent_conditioner_dropout_rate = 0.1` (reduced from 0.2)

## Next Steps if Issues Persist
If training loss still doesn't decrease:
1. Try even simpler architecture (remove SE attention blocks)
2. Use BatchNorm instead of GroupNorm
3. Reduce learning rate further
4. Check data preprocessing pipeline for issues
